          <p className="text-[#8C8C8C] leading-relaxed">
            Bitcoin's most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market. 
            It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts 
            who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives.

          <p className="text-[#8C8C8C] leading-relaxed">
            The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently 
            inspired the development of thousands of competing projects. The entire cryptocurrency market — now worth more 
            than $2 trillion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin.

          <p className="text-[#8C8C8C] leading-relaxed">
            Over the years, the idea of a virtual, decentralized currency has gained acceptance among regulators and 
            government bodies. Although Bitcoin is not recognized as legal tender in most countries, it enjoys wide 
            acceptance and can be traded for various fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges.

          <p className="text-[#8C8C8C] leading-relaxed">
            Bitcoin's supply is limited to 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset. This scarcity, combined 
            with growing adoption, has contributed to its value appreciation over time and positioned it as "digital gold" 
            in many investors' portfolios.
